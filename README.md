# JSON Recipe - JavaScript/TypeScript library

This is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for working with [JSON
Recipe](https://github.com/ianprime0509/jsonrecipe-schema) data. The aim of
this library is to make it easier for library and application developers to
work with JSON Recipe data without having to deal with low-level details like
parsing human-readable ingredient descriptions.
